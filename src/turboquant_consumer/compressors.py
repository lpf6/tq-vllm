"""Production-grade compressors for transformer KV cache tensors.

Wraps the core TurboQuant quantizers to handle real model tensor shapes
([batch, heads, seq_len, head_dim]), dtype conversion, and device placement.

- TurboQuantCompressorV2: For key cache — full two-stage with QJL correction.
  Supports asymmetric_attention_scores() for computing attention directly
  from compressed keys without full dequantization.

- TurboQuantCompressorMSE: For value cache — MSE-only Stage 1 compression.
  Lighter weight, appropriate since values only need reconstruction accuracy
  (not inner-product preservation).

Reference: Section 5 of arXiv 2504.19874.

Examples:
    ```python
    key_comp = TurboQuantCompressorV2(head_dim=128, bits=3)
    val_comp = TurboQuantCompressorMSE(head_dim=128, bits=3)

    compressed_k = key_comp.compress(key_states)
    compressed_v = val_comp.compress(value_states)

    scores = key_comp.asymmetric_attention_scores(query, compressed_k)
    values = val_comp.decompress(compressed_v)
    ```
