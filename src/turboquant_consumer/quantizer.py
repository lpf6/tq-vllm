"""TurboQuant two-stage vector quantizer.

Implements the core TurboQuant algorithm: random orthogonal rotation
followed by optimal scalar quantization (Stage 1, MSE) and optional
QJL residual correction (Stage 2, unbiased inner products).

Stage 1 (TurboQuantMSE):
    Rotate → quantize each coordinate independently → store indices.
    Minimizes mean squared error. Best for value cache reconstruction.

Stage 2 (TurboQuantProd):
    Allocate (bits-1) to Lloyd-Max + 1 bit to QJL sign correction.
    Produces unbiased inner product estimates. Best for key cache
    where attention scores depend on Q·K^T dot products.

Reference: Sections 3-4 of arXiv 2504.19874.

Examples:
    MSE quantization for value cache reconstruction:

    ```python
    quantizer = TurboQuantMSE(dim=64, bits=4)
    indices, norms = quantizer.quantize(values)
    reconstructed = quantizer.dequantize(indices, norms)
    ```

    Unbiased inner products for key cache attention:

    ```python
    quantizer = TurboQuantProd(dim=64, bits=4)
    indices, norms, signs, res_norms = quantizer.quantize(keys)
    scores = quantizer.estimate_inner_product(query, indices, norms, signs, res_norms)
    ```
