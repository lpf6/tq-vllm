## Future Work

### P3: Molmo2-8B validation

**Goal:** Confirm CompressedDynamicCache works with the larger model. The 8B model recognizes character names (e.g., "Elaine", "Kramer") which 4B cannot.

**Approach:** Run benchmark with `--model allenai/Molmo2-8B --compressed`. May need `bitsandbytes` 4-bit weight quantization to fit model + compressed cache in 24 GB.

**When:** After TQ4 nibble packing is validated on 4B. Using 4B for experiments is faster to set up and tear down.

### P4: Triton fused dequant-attention kernel

**Goal:** Fuse dequantization with attention computation to avoid materializing full decompressed tensors.

**Why:** Current `CompressedDynamicCache` dequantizes the ENTIRE cache at every layer at every generation step (11K+ vectors through a 128x128 matrix multiply). This is the source of the 2.35x overhead. A fused kernel would:
1. Read nibble-packed indices + fp32 norms directly
2. Compute centroid lookup + rotation + scaling inline
3. Compute Q @ K^T without materializing the full K tensor
4. Reduce both latency AND peak VRAM

**Complexity:** Medium-high. Requires Triton kernel development and correctness validation.

### P5: TQ3 bit-packing (research, nice-to-have)

**Goal:** Pack 3-bit indices at the theoretical optimum (48 bytes per 128 indices, 4.92x compression).

**Why deferred:** 3-bit indices cross byte boundaries, making parallel pack/unpack non-trivial. No PyTorch/Triton implementation exists — only C/CUDA (ik_llama.cpp). The 30% improvement over TQ4 nibble (4.92x vs 3.76x) doesn't justify the complexity until the easier wins are shipped.

### P6: vLLM native integration

**Goal:** Run TurboQuant as a vLLM KV cache backend, enabling compressed caching in production serving.

**Status:** vLLM currently supports FP8 KV cache only. No integer sub-byte support. The KV Offloading Connector API (Jan 2026) handles offloading tiers, not quantization. Integrating TurboQuant would require attention backend changes, not just connector API.

**Our path:** Monitor upstream. When vLLM ships TurboQuant support (expected Q2-Q3 2026), we adopt on day one with confidence from our validation work. Our codebase could also serve as a reference implementation for a vLLM contribution.

## Key Lessons

1. **FP16 norms are a trap.** At 10K+ token sequences across 36 layers, fp16 norm precision loss compounds and flips low-confidence logits. Always use fp32 for norms.

2. **QJL is invisible in drop-in mode.** Standard attention does `Q @ K.T` on decompressed keys. QJL correction only helps with `estimate_inner_product()` (custom kernel). Using QJL in drop-in mode wastes 1 bit of MSE resolution for nothing.

3. **Peak VRAM != KV cache size.** On Molmo2-4B with 11K tokens, forward-pass activations dominate peak VRAM (~90%). KV cache compression savings are real but invisible to `max_memory_allocated()`. They matter for max_model_len budgeting, not peak measurement.

4. **PyTorch treats uint8 as boolean masks.** Fancy indexing with uint8 tensors triggers boolean masking, not integer indexing. Always cast to `.long()` before centroid lookup.

5. **Don't fight byte alignment.** TQ4 nibble packing (2 values per byte) is trivial and gives 3.76x compression. TQ3 bit-packing (3-bit byte-crossing) is hard and only 30% better. Work with the hardware, not against it.

6. **No PyTorch sub-byte ecosystem.** `torch.uint3` etc. are placeholders with no ops. TorchAO packing is weight-quant-specific. Every KV cache implementation rolls its own Triton kernels. Plan accordingly.
